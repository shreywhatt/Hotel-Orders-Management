Hotel Orders Management project is a beginner level project programmed using C++ language. 
The project contains three main parts;
1] Menu
   In the menu, we program the menu with serial number and name of items like Rooms, Pasta, Burger, Shakes, Noodles etc and add prices to them

2] Order Placement 
   In the second part we add functionality to the menu, by which the user will be able to place order by entering corresponding item's number from the menu.
